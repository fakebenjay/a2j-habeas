      <span class="hed">Capital Sentence Reversals</span>
      <p class="dek">The number of reversed death sentences has kept relatively steady despite the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which was touted as a way to bring finality to state criminal proceedings.
        Reversals briefly peaked in the early 2000s following two Supreme Court decisions that limited the application of the death penalty. The reversals decline since 2010 coincides with a drop in death sentences along the same period.</p>

      <span class="hed">Average Elapsed Time Between Death Sentence and Execution</span>
      <p class="dek">The average time between a capital sentence and execution has more than tripled since the 1980s, despite the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which sought to curtail federal review of state
        death penalty cases to ensure a more swift carrying out of death sentences.</p>

      <br />
      <strong style="font-size:14pt;"><em>TEXAS v. MELISSA LUCIO</em></strong>
      <p style="margin-top:8px;font-size:11pt;line-height:normal;padding-bottom:5pt;">
        Melissa Lucio, a Latino Texas woman convicted for the death of her 2-year-old daughter, claims she was represented by grossly incompetent attorneys who failed to challenge a confession that her habeas lawyers say was coerced from her under
        duress. Her execution, set for April 27, was stayed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>
      <br />
      <strong style="font-size:14pt;"><em>TEXAS v. RODNEY REED</em></strong>
      <p style="margin-top:8px;font-size:11pt;line-height:normal;padding-bottom:5pt;">
        Rodney Reed, a Black man convicted by an all-white jury for the rape and murder of Stacy Stites, a white woman, claims state prosecutors hid disculpating evidence from the jury, including statements pointing to domestic violence arguments
        between Stites and her fiance, a white police officer who was the prime suspect, and that described Reed and Stities in a sexual relationship. Federal courts denied Reed’s request to analyze potentially exonerating crime scene DNA evidence.
        The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.</p>
      <br />
      <strong style="font-size:14pt;"><em>MISSOURI v. LAMAR JOHNSON</em></strong>
      <p style="margin-top:8px;font-size:11pt;line-height:normal;padding-bottom:5pt;">
        Lamar Johnson, a Black Missouri man sentenced to life without parole for a murder, claims his conviction was illegally obtained through prosecutorial misconduct and fabricated evidence, including a statement from a jail informant who claimed
        to have heard him confess to the crime. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney believes Johnson is innocent. The Missouri Supreme Court denied habeas relief and he remains imprisoned.</p>
